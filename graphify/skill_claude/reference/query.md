# graphify query / path / explain

Loaded on demand by `SKILL.md` to answer questions against an existing graph.

## Interpreter guard for subcommands

Before running any subcommand below (`--update`, `--cluster-only`, `query`, `path`, `explain`, `add`), check that `.graphify_python` exists. If it's missing (e.g. user deleted `graphify-out/`), re-resolve the interpreter first:

```bash
if [ ! -f graphify-out/.graphify_python ]; then
    GRAPHIFY_BIN=$(which graphify 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$GRAPHIFY_BIN" ]; then
        PYTHON=$(head -1 "$GRAPHIFY_BIN" | tr -d '#!')
        case "$PYTHON" in *[!a-zA-Z0-9/_.-]*) PYTHON="python3" ;; esac
    else
        PYTHON="python3"
    fi
    mkdir -p graphify-out
    "$PYTHON" -c "import sys; open('graphify-out/.graphify_python', 'w', encoding='utf-8').write(sys.executable)"
fi
```

## For /graphify query

Two traversal modes - choose based on the question:

| Mode | Flag | Best for |
|------|------|----------|
| BFS (default) | _(none)_ | "What is X connected to?" - broad context, nearest neighbors first |
| DFS | `--dfs` | "How does X reach Y?" - trace a specific chain or dependency path |

### Step 0 — Constrained query expansion (REQUIRED before traversal)

graphify's `query` CLI matches nodes via case-folded substring + IDF — there is **no stemming, no synonyms, no cross-language match** inside the binary. If the user's question uses different language or different domain vocabulary than the graph's labels (user says "обработчик" / graph says "handler"; user says "authentication" / graph says "Guardian"), the literal matcher returns 0 hits and the answer collapses to noise.

Fix this **without inventing tokens** by expanding the query against the actual graph vocabulary first:

1. Extract the token vocabulary from node labels:
```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -c "
import json, re
from pathlib import Path
data = json.loads(Path('graphify-out/graph.json').read_text())
vocab = set()
for n in data['nodes']:
    for c in re.findall(r'[^\W\d_]+', n.get('label','') or '', re.UNICODE):
        parts = re.findall(r'[A-Z]+(?=[A-Z][a-z])|[A-Z]?[a-z]+|[A-Z]+', c) or [c]
        for p in parts:
            t = p.lower()
            if 3 <= len(t) <= 30:
                vocab.add(t)
Path('graphify-out/.vocab.txt').write_text('\n'.join(sorted(vocab)))
print(f'vocab: {len(vocab)} tokens')
"
```

2. Read `graphify-out/.vocab.txt`. Then for the user's question, select **up to 12 tokens from this exact list** that semantically match the query intent. Hard constraints:
   - You MUST pick only tokens present in the vocabulary file. Do NOT invent tokens.
   - If a query concept has no plausible token in the vocab, skip it — do not substitute a near-synonym from training memory.
   - If **no** vocab tokens match the query at all, output an empty list and tell the user the corpus has no relevant vocabulary for this question. Do not fabricate a search.
   - Translate cross-language: Russian "аутентификация" → look for `auth`, `credential`, `token`, `security` IFF present in vocab.
   - Morphology: "handlers" maps to `handler` IFF present; "todos" maps to `todo` IFF present.

3. Print the selection explicitly to the user before running the query, so the expansion is auditable:
```
Query expanded to (from graph vocab, N tokens): [token1, token2, ...]
```
If the list is empty, say so plainly and stop — do not proceed to traversal.

### Step 1 — Traversal

Build the **expanded query string** by joining the selected tokens with spaces. Use this string as `QUESTION` below — NOT the original user question. (The original question is preserved only for `save-result` at the end.)

```bash
graphify query "QUESTION"
# or: graphify query "QUESTION" --dfs --budget 3000
```

Answer using **only** what the graph output contains. Quote `source_location` when citing a specific fact. If the graph lacks enough information, say so - do not hallucinate edges.

After writing the answer, save it back into the graph so it improves future queries. Include the expanded tokens inside the `--answer` text (e.g. `"Expanded from original query via vocab: [tokens]. Then traversed..."`) so the next `--update` extracts the expansion history as a graph node:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -m graphify save-result --question "ORIGINAL_QUESTION" --answer "ANSWER" --type query --nodes NODE1 NODE2
```

Replace `ORIGINAL_QUESTION` with the user's verbatim question, `ANSWER` with your full answer text (containing the expanded-token trace), `NODE1 NODE2` with the list of node labels you cited. This closes the feedback loop: the next `--update` will extract this Q&A as a node in the graph.

## For /graphify path

Find the shortest path between two named concepts in the graph.

```bash
graphify path "NODE_A" "NODE_B"
```

Replace `NODE_A` and `NODE_B` with the actual concept names. Then explain the path in plain language - what each hop means, why it's significant.

After writing the explanation, save it back:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -m graphify save-result --question "Path from NODE_A to NODE_B" --answer "ANSWER" --type path_query --nodes NODE_A NODE_B
```

---

## For /graphify explain

Give a plain-language explanation of a single node - everything connected to it.

```bash
graphify explain "NODE_NAME"
```

Replace `NODE_NAME` with the concept the user asked about. Then write a 3-5 sentence explanation of what this node is, what it connects to, and why those connections are significant. Use the source locations as citations.

After writing the explanation, save it back:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -m graphify save-result --question "Explain NODE_NAME" --answer "ANSWER" --type explain --nodes NODE_NAME
```
